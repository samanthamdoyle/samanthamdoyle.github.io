    <div class="imagedescription">Gucci's Meme Campaign 2017</div>

    <div class="articlebodyheading">
    <p>Gucci just hired professional meme makers...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="articlebodytext">
    <p>If there was ever a fashion house willing to embrace mocking themselves, it would be Gucci. With an anything goes attitude and very internet-friendly approach to maximalism, Alessandro Michele’s Gucci has become the calling card for the millennial cool kid. So the fact they’re making memes is not necessarily a surprise. </p>

    <p>In a clever advertisement for Gucci timepieces, the Italian heritage brand has enlisted the help of ‘international meme creators’ to help them create an online advertising campaign based around memes.</p>

    <p>With further help from artists and other Instagram users (think @textsfromyourexistentialist and @beigecardigan) the memes are lol-inducing at their best, taking everyday things and turning them into Gucci-related pockets of humour. Including lines like “When you get a Gucci watch and have to show it off” next to a picture of a sleeve of a shirt with a watch-sized rip in it, and “When he buys you flowers instead of a Gucci watch” alongside a Gothic-esque classical painting, the memes are the ultimate #troll coming from an otherwise traditional brand. </p>

    <p>Of the collaborations, Gucci posted the following to Instagram: “Debuting #TFWGucci (That Feel When Gucci). The House’s new collaborative art project in the digital space is a line-up of memes featuring the new #LeMarchédesMerveilles collection of watches.”</p>

    <p>Meme creators were approached by the fashion house to create memes featuring timepieces from different Gucci lines, including the Le Marché des Merveilles collection of watches. And, according to a statement from the brand, many of the memes are the "result of a two-way or three-way collaboration". The campaign intends to demonstrate Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele's "desire to engage with a wider creative community than that which traditionally locates around the world of fashion."</p>
