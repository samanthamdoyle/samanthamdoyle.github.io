    <div class="intro">hello, let me introduce myself...</div>

    <div class="introtext">
      My name is <span class="whitetext">sam</span> and I have a curiosity towards
    appropriateness in regards to humor. Don’t get me wrong, I
    love an <span class="whitetext">offensive meme</span> just as much as you do. But I want to
    share some interesting information and research I have found
    about the lengths we go to make people laugh.<br><br>
    It’s 2017 and social media has brought us some <span class="whitetext">beautiful
    tings.</span> Providing us with a public platform to post absolutely
    anything anytime and anywhere, we are able to take on
    the role of an author without any prior experience or
    prerequisits. Pretty fucking awesome.<br><br>
    Who really knows the <span class="whitetext">identity</span> behind a meme creator?
    Perhaps it’s the nerd behind the IT services desk or maybe
    it’s your grandma just trolling the shit out of society and
    what we’ve become. Let me help you explore the issues we
    face when approaching humor and the sensitivity barrier of
    offensive memes. Let’s start from the <span class="whitetext">beginning,</span> where these
    ridiculous tings started...<br><br>
    These articles have been found from many different <span class="whitetext">sources</span>
    and I don’t claim any as my own.<br>
