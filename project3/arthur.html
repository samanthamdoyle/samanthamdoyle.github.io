    <p>Arthur creators aren't down with ur <span class="whitetext">NSFW memes</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="articlebodytext">
    <p>It’s safe to say that anyone with a social media account has probably seen the trending Arthur memes. The 20-year-old Emmy Award winning children’s show has been subject to the explicit humour of those who grew up watching it, with memes popping up all over the place with themes that aren’t usually discussed in the after-school timeslot. Many of the memes making the rounds are par for the course — just stills of Arthur and his family and overlaying them with a funny saying or relatable modern moment. But, as can be expected, some of the memes have taken a more explicit, not safe for work turn.</p>

    <p>Arthur's viral moment seemingly began with the first episode of the fourth season titled "Arthur's Big Hit," in which he actually punches his younger sister D.W. for breaking his model airplane. The trend started with fists but has now grown into a full-blown obsession with the chill aardvark and his crew. </p>

    <p>The Boston based network behind the animation, WGBH, have hit back, sharing their ‘disappointment’ with the few memes “that are outside of good taste”. WGBH spokeswoman Ellen London, said in a press release that they hope “Arthur and his friends will be depicted in a way that is respectful and appropriate for all audiences, including young Arthur fans and their families”.</p>

    <p>And sure, there are probably a few in the mix (alright, most of them) that have made us go “Ooh, too far..?” but despite WGBH’s disapproval, you have to admit it’s kind of cool to see we’re still able to relate to one of our animated favourites in a totally different phase of our lives. At the risk of ruining a childhood memory, check out some of the internet’s efforts to bring Arthur into 2016 that we have collected for you.</p>
