      <h4>
    <h5>The purpose of the ChildCare Action Project Condition (CAPCon) Alert lights is to give an at-a-glance indication of the suggested measure of urgency and attention to detail you should give to inspecting the CAP Entertainment Media Analysis Report for the movie BEFORE seeing the movie. Though the CAPCon Alert lights are inherently an indication of the relative amount of assaults on morality and decency in a film, they are not intended to indicate a threshold of acceptability or suitability of a film for your child(ren) OR yourself. We DO NOT assume to know, e.g., when it is acceptable (if ever) for your kids to be exposed to certain traditionally unacceptable programming. It is up to YOU -- the PARENT -- to decide whether it is acceptable for your child(ren) to be exposed to such programming, not us nor the Motion Picture Association of America.<br>
      "Fear of God" ... one of the most misunderstood and misused expressions from the Bible. So many use it against the believers saying God demands that you be afraid of Him when it couldn't be further from the Truth. Looking at the definition of "fear", where "fear of God" appears in the KJV there are three translations to "fear."
      yir'ah {yir-aw'}: respect, reverence, piety, revered
      pachad {pakh'-ad}: terror, dread, object of dread
      phobos {fob'-os}: reverence as in for one's husband (or wife)
      When pachad is used it speaks to that which His enemies should feel such as in 2 Chronicles 20:29 "And the fear [pachad] of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel." They were afraid of the power of God for those who oppose Him.

      But in other cases when yirah and phobos are used, it speaks to reverence, honor and respect such as in 2 Samuel 23:3 "The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear [yirah] of God", in 2 Corinthians 7:1 "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear [phobos] of God" and in Ephesians. 5:21 "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear [phobos] of God."

      So, if one opposes and rejects God one should dread (pachad) fear what He will do (and won't do). If one loves Him one should revere, honor and respect (yirah or phobos) fear Him. Yirah or phobos fear Him even in the marriage sense as we, the believers, will be collected as His Bride at the Rapture.

      I "fear" God. Deeply. But I am not afraid of Him.
