    <h2>SECOND LIFE</h2>

    Religious organizations have also begun to open virtual meeting places within Second Life. In early 2007, <span class="link">LifeChurch.tv</span>, a Christian church headquartered in Edmond, Oklahoma, and with eleven campuses in the US, created "Experience Island" and opened its twelfth campus in Second Life.<br>

    <h2>LIFECHURCH.TV</h2>
    In 2001, MetroChurch, a 25-year-old, nondenominational church in nearby Edmond, Oklahoma joined with Life.Church, effectively making it a multi-site church. Following the success of the additional location, the church launched campuses in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Stillwater, Oklahoma in 2002, and these new campuses began incorporating satellite video teaching into their services.[5] Bob Smietana; Rebecca Barnes (September 2005).

    <h2>HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
    The history of Christianity concerns the <span class="link">Christian religion</span>, Christendom, and the Church with its various denominations, from the 1st century to the present.<br>

    <h2>CHRISTIANITY</h2>
    <span class="link">Christianity</span> is a Abrahamic monotheistic[1] religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion,[2][3] with over 2.4 billion followers,[4][5][6] or 33% of the global population, known as Christians.[note 2] Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.[7]

Christian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles' Creed and Nicene Creed. These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, descended into hell, and rose from the dead, in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins. The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven, where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers. His incarnation, earthly ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection are often referred to as "the gospel", meaning "good news".[note 3] The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus's life and teaching, four of which—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible.
